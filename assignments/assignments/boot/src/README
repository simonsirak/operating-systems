Tools that you need:

nasm

qemu

grub-mkrescue
grub-pc-bin
xorriso


compile boot.asm uing nasm

> nasm -f bin -o boot.bin boot.asm

We can now start a virtual machine (QEMU) using the drive image

> qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=boot.bin,index=0,media=disk,format=raw

You can also build a VirtualBox hard drive and start a VirtulBox machine.

> qemu-img convert -f raw -O vdi boot.bin boot.vdi

Now start VirualBox and create a new machine where you give boot.vdi
as the hard drive image.

You can also build a bootable USB drive and boot your own machine but
this will require that you set up the BIOS to take the USB drive as
the first hard drive to boot from. It will also require that you
machine can be set to allow legacy BIOS master boot records insted of
regular UEFI systems.

Building the GRUB system

> nasm -f elf32 multiboot_header.asm 
> nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm

> ld -m elf_i386 -o kernel.bin -T linker.ld multiboot_header.o kernel.o

> mkdir cdrom
> mkdir cdrom/boot
> mkdir cdrom/boot/grub
> cp kernel.bin cdrom/boot/

Create the grub.cfg file and then build the ISO image

> grub-mkrescue -o cdrom.iso cdrom

If everything works you should be able to run it. 

> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom cdrom.iso
