# operating-systems
These are notes/summaries that I took for ID1206 Operating Systems at KTH. The theory directory contains summaries from the 
awesome course book, "[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)" by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. I highly recommend that book!

Please keep in mind that my summaries may not always be correct; if something sounds fishy, I might have misunderstood something. I recommend reading the course book as well if something sounded weird!
